# Wagon Wheel — Implementation Progress

**Status:** Phase 3 complete (visual consistency + validation)  
**Last updated:** June 2026  

**Related:** [SCORING_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md](SCORING_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md) · [FIREBASE_SCHEMA.md](FIREBASE_SCHEMA.md)

## Overview

Broadcast-style wagon wheel for CrickFlow: scorers mark shot direction on a top-down ground view; coordinates are stored on each `ball_events` document and drive match, player, team, and career analytics.

## Progress checklist

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Feature toggle (`wagonWheelEnabled`, default OFF) | ✅ Done | Match creation, match rules screen, `MatchRulesEditor` |
| 2 | Eligibility rules (runs 1–6, NB from bat only) | ✅ Done | `wagon_wheel_eligibility.dart` |

| 15 | Unit tests | ✅ Done | `test/wagon_wheel_test.dart` |
| 16 | Tournament default match settings | ⏳ Pending | `TournamentModel` has no rules field yet |
| 17 | Bowler / team dedicated screens | ⏳ Pending | Providers exist; UI entry points TBD |
| 18 | Custom ground image asset | ⏳ Pending | `WagonWheelGroundRenderer` ready for image overlay |
| 19 | Zone validation (1–3 inside, 4 rope, 6 outside) | ✅ Done | `wagon_wheel_field_geometry.dart` |
| 20 | Striker wicket line origin | ✅ Done | Lines from batsman end, not pitch centre |
| 21 | Pitch length + boundary visuals | ✅ Done | ~33% shorter pitch; dark outside ground |
| 22 | Six line emphasis | ✅ Superseded | Phase 3: uniform line style for all runs |
| 23 | Uniform shot lines (colour only) | ✅ Done | `shotLineWidth`, `shotEndpointRadius` |
| 24 | Pixel-accurate boundary validation | ✅ Done | `WagonWheelCoordinateMapper` |
| 25 | Sixes outside only; 4s anywhere | ✅ Done | Zone A/B/C matrix |
| 26b | Six manual placement outside boundary only | ✅ Done | Inside taps snap along angle |
| 26 | Shared `WagonWheelRenderer` + fixed aspect | ✅ Done | No drift between screens |

## Architecture

```
LiveScoringScreen
  → WagonWheelEligibility.shouldCapture?
  → WagonWheelSelectionSheet (x%, y%)
  → BallEventInput.wagonWheel
  → MatchRepository.recordBall → Firestore ball_events.wagonWheel

Analytics
  → ballEventsProvider + WagonWheelAnalyticsService
  → WagonWheelChart / WagonWheelViewScreen
```

---

## Data schema (ball event)

```json
{
  "runs": 4,
  "batsmanRuns": 4,
  "strikerId": "player_123",
  "bowlerId": "player_456",
  "wagonWheel": {
    "enabled": true,
    "x": 67.2,
    "y": 24.1,
    "shotType": "four",
    "source": "manual"
  }
}
```

Coordinates are **always percentages** (0–100), never pixels. Pitch centre: `(50, 50)`.

## Scorer workflow

1. Toggle **Enable wagon wheel tracking** ON at match creation (default OFF).
2. Tap run **1–6** (or NB + runs off bat).
3. Wagon wheel sheet opens — tap/drag marker, **Confirm shot**.
4. Ball event saved with coordinates; scoring screen unchanged otherwise.
5. **Cancel** on sheet aborts the ball (no score recorded).
6. **Undo** removes the event and its wagon wheel data together.

## Routes

- `/wagon-wheel?matchId=…` — match wagon wheel
- `/wagon-wheel?batterId=…` — batter career
- `/wagon-wheel?bowlerId=…` — bowler conceded
- `/wagon-wheel?teamId=…` — team shots
- `/wagon-wheel?tournamentId=…` — tournament aggregate

---

## Next steps

1. Add `defaultMatchRules` to `TournamentModel` for tournament-level WW default.
2. Ship ground image asset and optional `Image.asset` fallback in painter.
3. Bowler tab on match hub + team detail wagon wheel cards.
4. Cloud Function: optional wagon wheel summary on match complete.
